Biology is undergoing a data generating revolution with new data being generated faster than can be analyzed and fully understood in biologically meaningful ways. This is partly due to the emphasis on novel data sets rather than novel analyses. As a plant biology community we should be developing models to understand the data that we already have and use the models to help us decide what experiments to do next. The biological question I am interested in is how plants make metabolic tradeoffs to compete for light resources above ground while also competing for nutrient and water resources belowground. To answer this question I am taking a systems genetics approach that leverages my background in whole plant physiology, metabolism, genomics and modeling.

# Postdoc Projects
The theme for my postdoc projects is using published data sets to generate models, use those models to inform new experiments, conduct those experiments, and update the model accordingly. More details to come.

* GxE eQTL mapping in *B.rapa* grown in crowded environments
* *B.rapa* trait database and QTL meta-analysis
* whole plant metabolic allocation tradeoffs in crowded environments
* genetically informed *B.rapa* physiological growth model
* computer vision and imaging pipelines for non-destructive model validation

#PhD Thesis Projects
My PhD work focused on three open questions in the plant climate change literature all involving the effects of elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on plants. 

* CO<sub>2</sub> Development Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014b.pdf)
* CO<sub>2</sub> Nitrogen Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014a.pdf)
* CO<sub>2</sub> Nitrogen Drought- Maize - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2011.pdf)

#Equipment Projects
It is really enjoyable to build equipment. It pulls together many ways of thinking about biological problems. It forces the biologist to really think about what process they are trying understand and how to quantify it using some sort of sensor. These projects help biologists build intuition about measurement error, instrument limitation, methods development, materials selection, and design. These are skills that are undervalued in biology. 

* Current- 3D plant digitizer. Many of these methods are coming out now! Exciting times. My implementation details soon to come. [video](https://vimeo.com/108757972)
* Single leaf Arabidopsis respiration chamber/pipeline - Publications (see Arabidopsis thesis work)
* Custom LICOR 6400 chamber head for soybean leaf respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Gillespie_etal_2012.pdf)
* Fruitfly Respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Walters_etal_2012.pdf)

#Undergraduate Thesis Project
* How will elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] alter soil and plant water status of the C<sub>3</sub>-crop soybean and the C<sub>4</sub>-crop maize? -[paper](/pdfs/Hussain_etal_2013.pdf)
