 I am interested in how plants make metabolic tradeoffs to compete for light resources above ground while also competing for nutrient and water resources belowground. I am taking a systems genetics approach that leverages my background in whole plant physiology, metabolism, and modeling. More details to come, but here is a project outline of current post-doc projects and former projects. 

#Postdoc Projects
* genotype by crowding environment eQTL mapping in B. rapa
* B.rapa trait database and QTL meta-analysis
* whole plant metabolic allocation tradeoffs in crowded environments
* genetically informed B. rapa physiological growth model
* computer vision pipelines for high-throughput phenotyping and non-destructive model validation

#PhD Thesis Projects
* CO2 Development Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014b.pdf)
* CO2 Nitrogen Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014a.pdf)
* CO2 Nitrogen Drought- Maize - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2011.pdf)

#Equipment Projects
* Single leaf Arabidopsis respiration chamber/pipeline - Publications (see Arabidopsis thesis work)
* Custom LICOR 6400 chamber head for soybean leaf respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Gillespie_etal_2012.pdf)
* Fruitfly Respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Walters_etal_2012.pdf)

#Undergraduate Thesis Project
* How will elevated [CO2] alter soil and plant water status of the C3-crop soybean and the C4-crop maize? -[paper](/pdfs/Hussain_etal_2013.pdf)
