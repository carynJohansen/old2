 I am interested in how plants make metabolic tradeoffs to compete for light resources above ground while also competing for nutrient and water resources belowground. I am taking a systems genetics approach that leverages my background in whole plant physiology, metabolism, and modeling. More details to come, but here is a project outline of current post-doc projects and former projects. 

# Postdoc Projects
* genotype by crowding environment eQTL mapping in B. rapa
* B.rapa trait database and QTL meta-analysis
* whole plant metabolic allocation tradeoffs in crowded environments
* genetically informed B. rapa physiological growth model
* computer vision pipelines for high-throughput phenotyping and non-destructive model validation

#PhD Thesis Projects
My PhD work focused on three open questions in the plant climate change literature all involving the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plants. 

* CO2 Development Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014b.pdf)

* CO2 Nitrogen Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014a.pdf)

* CO2 Nitrogen Drought- Maize - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2011.pdf)


#Equipment Projects
It is really enjoyable to build equipment. It pulls together many ways of thinking about biological problems. It forces the biologist to really think about what process they are trying understand and how to quantify it using some sort of sensor. These projects help biologists build intuition about measurement error. 

* Current- 3D plant digitizer. Many of these methods are coming out now! Exciting times. My implementation details soon to come. [video](https://vimeo.com/108757972)
* Single leaf Arabidopsis respiration chamber/pipeline - Publications (see Arabidopsis thesis work)
* Custom LICOR 6400 chamber head for soybean leaf respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Gillespie_etal_2012.pdf)
* Fruitfly Respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Walters_etal_2012.pdf)

#Undergraduate Thesis Project
* How will elevated [CO2] alter soil and plant water status of the C3-crop soybean and the C4-crop maize? -[paper](/pdfs/Hussain_etal_2013.pdf)
