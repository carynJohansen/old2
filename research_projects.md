 I am interested in how plants make metabolic tradeoffs to compete for light resources above ground while also competing for nutrient and water resources belowground. I am taking a systems genetics approach that leverages my background in whole plant physiology, metabolism, and modeling. There are only so many hours in the day so this site is a work in progress. More to come...until then, here is a project outline.

#Postdoc Projects
* genotype by crowding environment eQTL mapping in B. rapa
* B.rapa trait database and QTL meta-analysis
* whole plant metabolic allocation tradeoffs in crowded environments
* genetically informed B. rapa physiological growth model
* computer vision pipelines for high-throughput phenotyping and non-destructive model validation
