I am currently a NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the Maloof Lab at UC Davis interested in the intersection of biology and computation. I have a background in carbon and nitrogen metabolism resource allocation. I am currently blending this eco-physiological training with computational and quantitative genetics to build a whole plant model of the Shade Avoidance Syndrome in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa.
