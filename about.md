I am a NSF Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Maloof Lab](http://malooflab.openwetware.org/) at UC Davis interested in the intersection of biology and computation. During my graduate work I studied the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the [Leakey Lab](http://lab.igb.illinois.edu/leakey/welcome). I am currently blending this eco-physio-genomics training with computational and quantitative genetics to build a genetically informed whole plant model of the Shade Avoidance Syndrome in *Brassica rapa* and *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I am co-advised on this postdoc project by [Dr. Dan Kliebenstein](http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/kliebenstein/).
