I am currently a co-founder and the VP of Genomics at [Rev Genomics](https://www.revgenomics.com/). Rev Genomics leverages large datasets to make genetic improvements in high-value crops.


During my graduate work I studied the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the [Leakey Lab](http://lab.igb.illinois.edu/leakey/welcome). I blended this eco-physio-genomics training with computational and quantitative genetics to build genetically informed growth models of *Brassica rapa* and *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I was co-advised on this NSF postdoctoral research fellowship project by [Dr. Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/) and [Dr. Dan Kliebenstein](http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/kliebenstein/).


I am generally interested in the complexities of nature and choose problems that require (at least) a paper and pencil to work out. Plants are fascinating because they integrate internal developmental program information with external environmental information in order to successfully produce viable offspring. It is amazing that the same genotype of plant can be grown in two different environments and have very different physiology, growth and morphology as outputs. The fact that developmental plasticity is noisy, yet reproducible suggests that one can understand the complexity by modeling the interacting components. If done correctly, modeling should lead to new insights about the system that is being studied. Statistical, mechanistic, empirical, or conceptual models all have great utility in understanding complexity. Simply writing down any style of model will quickly show what is known and what is not known about the biological system under examination. It is the mentally fuzzy components of the model that need more attention through background reading, conceptual or mathematical refinement. Once these boxes are checked then new experiments can be **designed**. The sheer amount of data being generated in biology is staggering. Without prior experimental design, models, and time to digest the complexity of large datasets there is little value to justify the expense in the first place. This is the importance of quality models. I use models as tools to understand the beauty and complexity of nature.
