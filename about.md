I am currently a co-founder and the VP of Genomics at [Rev Genomics](https://www.revgenomics.com/). Rev Genomics leverages large datasets to make genetic improvements in high-value crops.


During my graduate work I studied the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism in the [Leakey Lab](http://lab.igb.illinois.edu/leakey/welcome). I blended this eco-physio-genomics training with computational and quantitative genetics to build a genetically informed growth models of *Brassica rapa* and *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I was co-advised on this NSF postdoctoral research fellowship project by [Dr. Julin Maloof](http://malooflab.phytonetworks.org/) and [Dr. Dan Kliebenstein](http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/kliebenstein/).
