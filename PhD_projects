#PhD Project

My PhD work focused on three open questions in the plant climate change literature all involving the effects of elevated atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> on plants. 

### CO<sub>2</sub> Development Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014b.pdf)

### CO<sub>2</sub> Nitrogen Respiration- Arabidopsis - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2014a.pdf)

### CO<sub>2</sub> Nitrogen Drought- Maize - [paper](/pdfs/Markelz_etal_2011.pdf)

#Equipment Projects
It is really enjoyable to build equipment. It pulls together many ways of thinking about biological problems. It forces the biologist to really think about what process they are trying understand and how to quantify it using some sort of sensor. These projects help biologists build intuition about measurement error, instrument limitation, methods development, materials selection, and design. These are skills that are undervalued in biology. 

#### 3D plant digitizer. Many of these methods are coming out now! Exciting times. I am working on this with some awesome undergrads. We have a prototype robot to collect this data for us, but we are looking forward to the summer break to really focus on getting this working. [video]

#### Custom LICOR 6400 chamber head for soybean leaf respiration - [paper](/pdfs/Gillespie_etal_2012.pdf)

#### Fruitfly Respiration
I modified the Arabidopsis leaf chamber to accommodate little mesh bags of flys[paper](/pdfs/Walters_etal_2012.pdf)

#Undergraduate Thesis Project
#### How will elevated [CO<sub>2</sub>] alter soil and plant water status of the C<sub>3</sub>-crop soybean and the C<sub>4</sub>-crop maize? -[paper](/pdfs/Hussain_etal_2013.pdf)
